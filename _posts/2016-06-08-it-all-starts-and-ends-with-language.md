# It all starts and ends with Language.

I'm always fascinated by the different types of languages used in different cultures and how they vary from my main language, English, or Canadian English to be more specific. I guess it stems from natural human curiosity, or jus tthe fact that I also speak a second language, Cantonese. 

Now before you say you ever make the mistake of wanting to speak Chinese or looking to learn how to speak Chinese, please understand this; **Chinese is only written and not spoken, what is spoken is a dialect that acts as a medium to verbally communicate the written Chinese characters**. 

That is all.

There, I just saved you countless eye rolls and heckling from the Chinese variety; now have some rice. 

Chinese is the written language used across China including Hong Kong, Taiwan and you'll even see it in Japan, but it's called Kanji instead. This all stems back from the Warring States Period (475 to 221 BC) when China was not a unified country but rather a mishmash of various states all vying for power and control over each other. It wasn't until the first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, that China finally had one unified way of communicating across the country. 

Of course, there are different dialects or ways of speaking. For example, you'll have Cantonese (which you'll hear quite a bit in Hong Kong) or Mandarin (which you'll definitely hear about 95% of the time you're in China) or Toishanese (Aka. Taishanese) or Shanghainese etc; yet the writing, and the meaning of the characters that make up the Chinese language is the same. Though that itself is also beginning to change in our lifetime as there is now the "Traditional" Way of writing Chinese and the "Simplified" Way of writing Chinese. 

A way to look at it would be seeing the "Traditional" Way of writing Chinese as an evolution of the symbols and characters. See, with many of the characters, they all started off as pictures of what they meant. Such as with the Chinese character for day, it would look like the sun because each day as we know is marked by the rising and setting of the sun.

Learning how to read or write Chinese with the "Traditional" Way I find makes much more sense because if you don't know the character, you could at least look at the other characters that make it up and find the meaning that way. Also, you could learn how to write it properly by knowing which other characters make it up. It's just like with English where we can sound out the letters of words to pronounce it, or know how to write it based on knowing what sound each letter makes and connecting that with what we hear when an unfamiliar word is spoken before writing it.

Now, when we look at the "Simplified" Way of writing Chinese, it's honestly like someone was on crack when they came up with it. Okay, maybe that was a little harsh, as they did keep some of the same ways of writing in the traditional way. But for the most part, there is no rhyme or rhythm nor logic to why certain characters are written in the way they are. 

I mean, it does take less time to write out some of the characters for sure, and if that's the main goal then it's definitely been achieved, for the short term because let's be honest; with this way of writing, you'd have to memorize a fucking ridiculous amount of characters in order to read the language and that in itself will slow down the writing of the characters and the meaning behind them. It would be like speaking, reading and writing in English then being asked to start reading and writing in Russian without learning the Russian language at all. 

Perhaps, this is just the rant of a Canadian born Chinese who learned how to write in the Traditional Way and just doesn't see the point of using the "Simplified" Way as it makes no fucking sense at all. However, I digress because for the ones who have never learned any better, they wouldn't know any better. And if you were taught the Simplified Way from the get go, then the Traditional way may seem much more convoluted... or not.

All I see is this, that the Traditional Way of writing actually has a point behind why the characters look the way they do since after all, characters in that language are symbolic representations of material or immaterial concepts. Or at least they started out to be in the beginning.

However, I'm not able to shake this feeling that without seeing where we have come from, it will definitely hamper where we can go in the future and that applies to language as well. After all, as Benjamin Franklin once said "Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it". 

It was because there were too many dialects, languages and ways of writing that led Qin Shi Huang to unify China under one single language, one single way of reading and writing. This definitely helped with easing communications across the entire country and of course this also played into his role of exerting control over his subjects and the subjects of the states he conquered. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ed67ffdf-c532-4117-812f-a8b0c0d6a46d.jpg)

In the end, what better way to control someone than to have them think, read, write and speak in your language?

After all, "It is no nation that we inhabit, but a language. Make no mistake; our native tongue is our true fatherland" (Emil Cioran).

It only takes one person with the ambition and drive to conquer and repeat what had happened thousands of years ago. But it also takes only one person with the ambition and drive to unify the world under a single way of communicating and this may sound really out there, however I don't believe that way of communicating will be through spoken words at all.

Language, can be so limiting in so many ways. Even when trying to share an experience we have with each other, it never really does the experience justice now does it? 

Try reading Khalil Gibran's "The Prophet" in English and then read it again in Arabic or vice versa. The English translation doesn't do it justice at all. 

Which leads me to think that, if only we could download into each other's minds exactly what we saw, felt, thought or heard; that in itself would eliminate any miscommunication or misunderstandings due to lack of context, imagination, fluency in the language and/or experience.

In that way, we'd be one step closer to world peace since after all, I believe that much of the chaos and destruction we have today stems from our inability to understand one another, and it all starts with Language.
