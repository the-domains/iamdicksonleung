<p>A shining example would be, Mao Zedong, or you may know of him as Chairman Mao of the Communist Party of the People's Republic of China. There was a time when he was being insulted straight to his face and all he did was just smile and act polite. However, not long after that meeting, the person who insulted him wound up being killed by an assassin sent by Mao. </p><p>In fact, one time this year when I was sitting front row at a Persian Comedy show in the Orpheum Theatre, in Vancouver, I was picked as the butt of almost all the comedian's jokes. All I did was laugh and take it, because it was a comedy show and everyone was just there to have fun. However, he did bring up some concern in his set that this may be his last show because he might wind up getting kidnapped by some Chinese people later sent by me. I'm no Mao Zedong and thankfully I was raised in Canada, so tolerance and open mindedness were a part of my education.</p><p>Still, it's not only China that has come up with ways to passive aggressively handle situations, in fact, wherever you go there is outright aggressiveness and passive aggressiveness. However, as a society today we look down on outright aggressiveness and at times even punish it severely yet passive aggressiveness goes underneath the radar. And what better ways to see it happen than in two professions where passive aggressiveness rules the ropes? </p><p>The first is in Flight Attending. When I was being trained as a Flight Attendant we were being indoctrinated into being passive aggressive if needed because telling someone to get their own damn Coca-Cola would have been cause of being reprimanded. At the same time, we learned how to be passive aggressive too a Flight Attendant.</p><p>If there is ever a Flight Attendant that pisses you off. Just tell them this:</p><p>"I'll just take a comment card".</p><p>The next is in the Legal field. With all the TV shows like Suits and Law & Order, I'm sure you've heard many times one or two lawyers say the following phrase.</p><p>"With all due respect your honor" or "With all due respect....".</p><p>It sounds nice and respectful but in actual Lawyer lingo it means:</p><p>"Fuck you".</p><p>The next is when a lawyer addresses another lawyer during the court of law. </p><p>When they say, "My learned friend here...." really means "This Fucking Asshole..."</p><p>I know, this is passive aggressiveness to another level and it doesn't look like it's going to go away.</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="25"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="26"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="27"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="28"><span data-reactid="29"><!-- react-empty: 30 --><h2 data-reactid="31"><a data-reactid="32">I AM Dickson Leung</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="34"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="35"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="36"></div></section></div></div>
